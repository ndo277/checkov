[Checkov Live Demo](https://checkov-1.herokuapp.com/)

Checkov is a web application where users can create an account to keep track of all their tasks. Users can also add steps to any task. Tasks and steps can be edited and deleted. Users can keep track of completed tasks and steps by checking them off. Users can filter by completed or incomplete tasks with the navbar, and/or search for individual tasks with the search bar. 

I engineered Checkov's backend using Ruby on Rails for ease of rapid development. I used ReactJS to implement the frontend, and Redux for  state management.
